# Cord Tools Kubernetes Helm Charts

The code is provided as-is with no warranties.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```console
  helm repo add cord-tools https://cord-tools.github.io/helm-charts
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
cord-tools` to see the charts.
